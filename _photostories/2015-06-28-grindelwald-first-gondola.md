We gently float up from Grindelwald to First in the security of the gondola. Amazing views accompany us all the way up.
 Once up, it's hard to take your eyes from the majestic mountains - you are afraid they might fall upon you... 
 
 Things could also get airy: On the Flying Fox (Tyrolienne) First Flyer at up to 80 km per hour, on the suspension bridge of the First Cliff Walk (opened recently)
  or on the agile Mountain Carts with the wind in your hair. First is starting point for many hikes too. **Click on any of the pictures to 
  see what I am talking about**:

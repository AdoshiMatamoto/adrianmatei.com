A must do journey you need to take if you are in the Interlaken area of Switzerland. Once you reach the top you have
 amazing view on the Lake Brienz (German: Brienzersee) and the surrounding Swiss Alps, topping with Jungfrau, MÃ¶nch and Eiger. 
  The trip up and down by the steam train is lots of fun too. But let the pictures speak for themselves.

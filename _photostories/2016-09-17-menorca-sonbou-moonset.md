One of advantages of being an early bird and having the hotel near the beach, is that you can explore the coast early when no one is around... One morning
I got to see one of nicest moonset so far... Sunsets are also amazing in [Son Bou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Bou), but I'll leave that for
another #photostory... For now enjoy the moonset and the coast walk - **click on a picture to

A journey you just need to make if you are around Lake Brienz (German: Brienzersee) in the mountainous Bernese Oberland region of central Switzerland.
 Once you reach the top you have amazing view on the lake and the surrounding Swiss Alps (amongst others Jungfrau, Mönch and Eiger). 
  The trip up and down by the steam train is lots of fun too. But I'll let the pictures speak for themselves - **click on a picture to

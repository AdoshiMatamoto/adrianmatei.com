One of my favorite places in Switzerland, where I am always looking forward returning to is [Oeschinen Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeschinen_Lake).
 This is a lake in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, close to Kandersteg in the Oeschinen valley.
  You can hike your way from Kandersteg to the lake (around 1h) or take the cable car and then need an extra 20 min walk to the lake...
   The landscapes are everywhere just amazing, no wonder it is an UNESCO World Heritage. But I'll let the pictures speak for themselves - **click on a picture to

 Check out the [Oeschinensee website](http://www.oeschinensee.ch/english/) to get more information about cable car timetable, prices, restaurant and hiking possibilities.

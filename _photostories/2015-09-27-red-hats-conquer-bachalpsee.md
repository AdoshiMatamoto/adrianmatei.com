Lake Bachalpsee travels around the world as a postcard. However, no photo is able capture the radiance of the lake.
 You just need to go there and see it for yourself. That does not require much effort. From Grindelwald take the Gondola to First. 
 From First, Lake Bachalpsee can be reached on foot in less than an hour, well maybe two if you travel with small children.

After buying Twitter in April, Elon Musk is willing to make his biggest investment 💰 yet and buy a few cherries 🍒 in May 💪

Due to rampant inflation 📈 and the Nasdaq meltdown 📉 in April, he will have to sell all his remaining Tesla stock,
but he backs up his buy, saying "we only get to live once on this planet 🌎"

> 🤫 Trusted sources also tell us that once he reaches Mars, first thing he will plant a cherry tree orchard and export the cherries back to earth
> so that other billionaires can afford it... Thank you, Elon for being a visionary 🙏

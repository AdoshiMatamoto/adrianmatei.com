Skating has become one of my favorite winter sports. But each time the season starts it's a bit difficult
in the beginning to remember the right moves. My approach to that is to watch a couple of videos on youtube to refresh my memory.
 This blog post contains a list with such videos, so I don't have to look through my bookmarks or search youtube again. 
 I will only have one bookmark then. 

> When practicing I suggest you wear some protection material like a helm or palm protection and  knee protection. Trust me, the 
ice can be pretty darn hard...
 

I want to pay a special tribute to Julia Durkee from [https://www.patreon.com/thrivediaries](https://www.patreon.com/thrivediaries)
 for taking the time to create and put these ice skating videos out there. She is the main youtuber featured in my list.

### How to Skate Backwards in Hockey - 2min

needed in hockey.

## Stopping - forward and backward
Stopping is another fundamental skill in ice skating you want to practice. You don't want to run into some 
kids standing on the side and screaming "out of the way" as somebody I know well, almost did.

## Forward crossovers
Crossovers are the maneuvers used to accelerate on curves, circles and corners.
 They make it possible for players to weave in and out of traffic, zigzag down the ice, change direction,
  turn from backward to forward, and move laterally (from side to side). Powerful, fast crossovers are essential for all hockey players.

### Forward Crossovers Lesson Part 2, Basic Figure Skating Tutorial
This is the second of two videos about how to do forward crossovers. In this video the focus is on a more extended push,
 and the ‘undercut spiral’ is introduced, which is beautiful on its own but really helps with the second push position.

## Transitions
This is when you are skating forwards and need to switch to skating backwards, or you are skating backwards and need to turn and go forwards.

### Proper Forwards and Backwards Transitions - Hockey Skating - 5min
In this video we cover the forward to backward transition and backwards to forwards transitions for hockey players. 
There are two ways to turn from forwards to backwards and vice versa.
 In the video we explain how a beginner can learn this move, and then how they should advance and become even better at it.

## **Inspiration or motivation**

### The mind behind Linux
Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice -- first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet,
 and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide.
  In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits
   that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. "I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer," Torvalds says.
    "I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... 
    but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in."

### The puzzle of motivation
Career analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation, starting with a fact that social scientists know,
 but most managers don't: Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think.
  Listen for illuminating stories -- and maybe, a way forward.

### The power of introverts

In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else, it can be difficult, even shameful, to be an introvert.
But, as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk, introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world,
and should be encouraged and celebrated.

### The power of vulnerability 
Bren√© Brown studies human connection -- our ability to empathize, belong, love.
In a poignant, funny talk, she shares a deep insight from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to know
herself as well as to understand humanity.

### My stroke of insight
Jill Bolte Taylor got a research opportunity few brain scientists would wish for: She had a massive stroke,
and watched as her brain functions -- motion, speech, self-awareness -- shut down one by one. An astonishing story.

### How I held my breath for 17 minutes
In this highly personal talk from TEDMED, magician and stuntman David Blaine describes what it took to hold his breath underwater
 for 17 minutes -- a world record (only two minutes shorter than this entire talk!) 
 -- and what his often death-defying work means to him. Warning: do NOT try this at home.

### Your body language may shape who you are

Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves.
Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that "power posing" -- standing in a posture of confidence,
even when we don't feel confident -- can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success.

### The happy secret to better work

We believe we should work hard in order to be happy, but could we be thinking about things backwards?
 In this fast-moving and very funny talk, psychologist Shawn Achor argues that, actually, happiness inspires us to be more productive.

  that might help you beat your next urge to smoke, snack or check a text while driving.

## **Leadership**

### How great leaders inspire action

Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership -- starting with a golden circle and the question:
 "Why?" His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King Jr. and the Wright brothers ...

### Sleep is your super power 

Sleep is your life-support system and Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality,
 says sleep scientist Matt Walker. In this deep dive into the science of slumber,
  Walker shares the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep
   -- and the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't, for both your brain and body.
    Learn more about sleep's impact on your learning, memory, immune system and even your genetic code
     -- as well as some helpful tips for getting some shut-eye.

### How to make stress your friend

Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat.
 But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you
  if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive,
   and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.

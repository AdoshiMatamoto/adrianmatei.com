I've played ping pong occasionally ever since I was a kid, with all kind of improvisations throughout the years if no bat,
 net or table tennis was available. But, I never played "profesionally" and with time passing less and less.
  Now I have decided this year will be the year when I play more of my favourite sport and take my play to the next level.
   I intend to join a table tennis club and practice more, maybe play in one the swiss regional leagues. 
 
First things first - start with some theory. Therefore, as with [volleyball](/blog/sport/awesome-video-list-of-volleyball-fundamentals),
 [ski](/blog/de/sport/ski-fahren-video-list-einsteiger-fortgeschrittenen) or [skating](/blog/sport/ice-skating-fundamentals-video-list),
  I put up a video list with drills and skills to practice in table tennis, from body posture, foot work, serving, attack, chop and 
  so on.   

> A special thanks to all the guys making these videos - your hard work is really appreciated.

### Footwork and recovery for short balls (with Mark Mitchell) - 9min
In this video, pro coach Mark Mitchell explains how to improve your footwork and recovery for short balls. Many players
 at the amateur level struggle with short balls, either by overreaching or getting jammed at the table. Mark demonstrates his footwork both in and out of the table for balls short to the backhand and balls short to the forehand.
 
 **Key takeaway - notice the little jump when recovery to make you ready to go again.**

### How to do an EVIL attacking push (with Craig Bryant) - 7min
In this video, top coach Craig Bryant, explains how to do an attacking push.

A push shot is usually considered to be a defensive shot. Too often it is used as a passive way to return a backspin serve.

But you can be much more aggressive with your push. By using extra speed, spin and depth, you can transform your basic push shot into something a bit evil. Something which can really mess your opponent up.

In the video, Craig explains and demonstrates how to do an attacking push. Plus there is lots of footage of me really struggling to cope with his push!

Just in the last second we decided to join the [Frifamily](https://www.frifemme.ch/about/) yesterday in a short outdoors tour
 around the Ch창teau de Vaumarcus nearby Neuchatel, Switzerland, an hour away from Bern. Boy I am glad we did.
  It was another of those outings in the Jura Mountains, you really feel good and wanna write about...

We had to park just a bit above the Castle, which has its own parking place, but was full of cars, whose owners were
attending a church service?!

Anyway, thus we got the chance to see the castle from a higher perspective:

 This small village was really beautiful with lots of modern villas, but I am really fond of the old ones, like this one
 from the "Vieux Village" (old village) street:

 After a five minute walk, we've reached the entry of the castle,

where you can't help but notice the secular tree in the castle's garden, which was unfortunately closed at this time

We were comforted by the superb view on the Lake Neuchatel and the Swiss Alps:

After having taken a last picture back, from the vineyard in front of the castle,

> I just love these paths through the vineyards, especially when the grapes are done :P
    
Look how small is my little son besides the mighty sequoia tree:

Full of the wisdom acquired from the secular trees, we head now for the woods, to check the younger spirits of nature

Don't forget to take some more pictures along the way

 > Personally, I was only imaging how would be to drive a rally car around here - thank you Colin McRae...

 At the end the wind forced us to take a shortcut through the woods, but in all was a really nice outing.
 I can't wait to come back in autumn for the wine tasting, I mean grape tasting...

To do sports is fun and healthy, but doing it right brings you more joy and satisfaction. This is also the case for volleyball, which I 
started playing again this summer at a local club - [awesome group](https://volleyliebefeld.ch/#post-78), thank you guys for having me.
With a couple of exceptions it's been like 20 years ago in high school when I played volleyball "semi-professionally" and memory of the game got a little bit rusty,
so  I needed a refresh. According to the motto "one picture is worth a thousand words, and one video a thousand pictures",
I thought I checked some youtube videos created by professionals, which show basic but very important 
techniques in volleyball to refresh my memory. The videos focus mostly on individual game.
 
> **Note**: You must know the game's rules and know the positions to fully take advantage of the videos - if you also need a refresh
you can check them out [here](http://www.fivb.ch/EN/Refereeing-Rules/RulesOfTheGame_VB.asp). Also note that I usually play as a setter and opposite right hand attacker,
so some videos are specific for these positions. 

I want to pay a special tribute to Coach Donny from [elevateyourself.org](https://www.elevateyourself.org/) for taking the time to create and put these videos out there.

> I must recognise I wish I knew some of the techniques shown here 20 years ago, but it's never too late to learn something new, is it?

## **Warm up**
I can't stress this enough but warming up might be the **most important**, yet by many considered (including me) most boring, part of the training.
It serves mainly two purposes:
1. it decrease the risk of injuries
2. it improves performance by preparing volleyball specific muscles needed in training or match, and thus have more joy and satisfaction, remember?

> In the following exercises I found myself warming up before trainings and matches in high school... Ahh it brings up such 
nice memories. Really, if you want to do something for your kid make them join a team sports club.

## **Passing / Pass**
A **volleyball pass** is a done with the objective to move the ball to a teammate called a setter.
There are basically two types of passing techniques:
1. **FOREARM PASS** (the most common) - join your arms from the elbows to the wrists and strike the ball with the fleshy part of your forearms in an underhand motion.
2. **OVERHAND PASS** – A pass executed with both hands open, controlled by the fingers and thumbs, played just above the forehead.

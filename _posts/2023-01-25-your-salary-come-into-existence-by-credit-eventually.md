Have you ever wondered where your salary it's coming from? Well, you'd say "of course the company I work for
pays it to me monthly, usually in my bank account". 

That might be true, but where does your company get it? 
Well, from the customers of the company, they pay for the services or products my company offers.

But where do these customers get the money?
Well, from their customers, and so on, why keep bothering me with these questions?

But where did the **initial** customer get it from, the one that had no customers?
... 

I think it's like this, we could call new companies, startups if you will, "initial" customers, but to come into existence
their founder(s) have to put down their own capital, come up with a business plan and the rest is most likely supplied by **creditors**,
either venture capitalists or banks. With this money, they create and offer their services and products to sell to their customers
to get money to pay back the founders and employees. 

Ok now I have three  questions?
1. Where is their "own" capital coming from?
2. Where is the money of VCs coming from?
3. Where is the money of the banks coming from?

### Own capital
It's the money from own savings, relatives, selling or "blocking" their assets so that the banks can grant the loan (credit).

Ok, but where do the savings, and assets come from? 

monetary base - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarybase.asp
in ch - 585,605.000 CHF mn in Dec 2022

money supply - https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/money-supply-m3
Money Supply M3 in Switzerland increased to 1172216 CHF Million in November

### VC 
To find out where VCs get their money it's easier if we asked Chat GPT, whose answer it's satisfactory in this case:

"Venture capitalists typically get their money from a variety of sources, including institutional investors such as pension funds,
endowments, and foundations, as well as high-net-worth individuals. Some venture capital firms also raise money from limited partners,
such as other venture capital firms or strategic investors. In addition, some venture capital firms are affiliated with
or backed by larger financial institutions, such as banks or private equity firms."
